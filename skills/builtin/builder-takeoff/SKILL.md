# Small Builder — Take-off to Schedule

For a 1–10 person general contractor or renovation outfit. Covers:

1. **Take-off** — extract a quantified material list from the user's scope description, sketch, or drawing
2. **Pricing** — wholesale prices from named trade counters
3. **Quote** — costed proposal using the shared roll-up
4. **Schedule of works** — week-by-week sequence with crew + dependencies

**Always read `home-build-shared` first** for units, BoM schema, costing roll-up, and client-data rules.

---

## When to invoke

Trigger on: "take off this scope", "what materials do I need for X", "build a quote for", "schedule of works", "how many days for", "what's the labour for", "compare Travis Perkins to Jewson", "what would a kitchen extension cost".

If the user pastes architect's drawings or a scope sheet, this is the skill.

---

## Phase 1 — Scope & take-off

### Capture the scope first

Ask the user to confirm in their own words. A take-off built off a fuzzy scope is worse than no take-off — it gets quoted, then re-quoted at change-order time, and the relationship goes sour.

The scope record (write to `/workspace/<project>/scope.md`) needs:

- One-paragraph description in the customer's own language
- Inclusions list (what we're doing)
- Exclusions list (what we're not — usually decorating, FF&E, soft furnishings, appliances unless specified)
- Drawings / photos referenced (filename + version)
- Any provisional sums (PC sums) — items priced by allowance, not measure (e.g. "PC sum £3,000 for kitchen taps and sink, customer choice")

### Then take off

Walk the scope room-by-room or trade-by-trade — pick whichever matches the drawings. For each item:

1. Identify the material category (`references/material-categories.md` — has the canonical list)
2. Measure the quantity in the right unit (m, m², m³, each)
3. Apply waste from `home-build-shared/references/waste-allowances.md`
4. Add to `bom.csv` per the canonical schema

**Common take-off pitfalls (don't make these):**

- Forgetting fixings, sealants, and adhesives — every plasterboard ceiling needs screws + scrim + filler + tape; quote them separately
- Forgetting wastage on offcuts — see waste table
- Forgetting plant hire — skip, scaffold, dehumidifier, mixer; these go in their own `plant.csv` with day-rate
- Forgetting first-fix vs second-fix — a kitchen has two visit-loads of plumbing and electrics, not one
- Forgetting access — second-floor work or no driveway parking changes the labour day count

### Plant hire

Goes in `/workspace/<project>/plant.csv`, same schema as `bom.csv` but `unit` is always `day`. Roll into the quote as a separate sub-total so the customer sees it.

## Phase 2 — Wholesale pricing

### Where to look (UK)

| Counter                 | Best for                                    | Account benefit                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Travis Perkins          | Heavy materials, timber, insulation         | Trade account = ~10–15 % off list  |
| Jewson                  | Same range as TP, often better in N England | Trade account                      |
| MKM                     | Mixed; strong in groundworks                | Trade account                      |
| Selco                   | Cash-and-carry, fast pickup                 | Trade card; lower margin           |
| Howdens                 | Kitchens, doors, flooring                   | Trade-only; pricing on application |
| Wickes                  | Mid-range materials, retail-priced          | Trade discount card                |
| Screwfix / Toolstation  | Consumables, tools, electrical, plumbing    | Click-and-collect 1 minute         |
| CEF / Edmundson / Rexel | Electrical wholesale                        | Trade only                         |
| Plumb Center / Wolseley | Plumbing wholesale                          | Trade only                         |

### Sourcing rules

- Use `web_search` to find the supplier's product page; `web_fetch` to read the live list price.
- **Quote at list price** unless the user has confirmed their trade discount in writing (saved in memory as e.g. "user has 12 % off TP list"). Customer sees list, you keep the discount as margin or pass some on — that's a business decision, not the bundle's call.
- One supplier per row. If you compare two suppliers, that's two rows in `bom.csv` with one marked `notes: alternate quote`.

### When the user has trade-counter export

If the user pastes a Travis Perkins / Jewson cart export, parse it directly into `bom.csv` rather than re-pricing line-by-line. Always cite the cart reference + export date in `notes`.

---

## Phase 3 — Quote

Run `bom_aggregator.py`, then build `quote.md` with the costing stack from `home-build-shared/references/cost-rollup-method.md`.

A small builder quote needs:

- Project description (one paragraph, customer's language)
- Inclusions / exclusions (verbatim from `scope.md`)
- The line-by-line build-up
- Payment schedule (typically 25 % deposit on order, 25 % on first-fix complete, 25 % on second-fix, 25 % on snag-list signed off — vary per job size)
- Programme (start date, expected duration, key dependencies on customer decisions)
- Validity (typically 30 days for prices, 90 days for the rest)
- T&Cs reference (don't paste your full T&Cs into the quote — link to a separate `terms.md`)

Render in plain Markdown — let the user convert to PDF / Word in their own toolchain.

---

## Phase 4 — Schedule of works

Build `/workspace/<project>/schedule.md` as a week-by-week table. Use `references/schedule-template.md`.

Sequencing rules:

1. Strip-out and protection first
2. Structural / first-fix carpentry
3. First-fix M&E (electrics, plumbing, HVAC) — these depend on the structure, so always after carpentry
4. Plastering — needs first-fix done and signed off
5. Drying time (1 mm per day rule of thumb for skim, faster with dehu) — this is real time on the programme
6. Second-fix carpentry (architraves, skirtings, doors)
7. Second-fix M&E (sockets, switches, sanitaryware, taps)
8. Decoration
9. Snagging

For each week, the schedule lists: **trade on site / what they're doing / what they need to be ready / what comes after them**.

Customer decisions go on the schedule too — "Week 4: customer must have selected tiles by end of week or week 6 slips."

## Day-rate planning

Default UK day rates (confirm with the user — these vary regionally):

| Trade        | Day rate (GBP) | Notes                                          |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Labourer     | 150–180        |                                                |
| Carpenter    | 220–280        | First-fix lower end, second-fix top end        |
| Plasterer    | 250–300        | + skimming work in m² for piecework jobs       |
| Tiler        | 220–300        | + £/m² for large bathrooms                     |
| Painter      | 180–230        |                                                |
| Electrician  | 280–350        | + Part P certification work charged separately |
| Plumber      | 280–350        |                                                |
| Bricklayer   | 250–300        | + £/1000 for piecework                         |
| Groundworker | 220–280        |                                                |
| Site manager | 300–400        | Often the user themselves on small jobs        |

For each crew member, multiply day rate × days on site (from the schedule). Record the assumption — the user can override per project.

## Bundled scripts and references

- `scripts/quote_builder.py` — reads `bom.csv` + `plant.csv` + a small JSON of overrides (margin %, VAT %, day-rate map), renders `quote.md`
- `references/material-categories.md` — canonical category list for take-offs
- `references/schedule-template.md` — week-by-week table template
- `references/scope-template.md` — scope.md template
